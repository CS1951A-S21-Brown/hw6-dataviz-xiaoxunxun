    <!--Written Questions 1-->
   <p style="font-size: 12px;"> *Q1: The static left-top bar figure tells the top 10 video games of all time. 
    The dynamic feature of a user-input year tells the top 10 video games of the specific year.  <br/>
    The static left-bottom map clealy tells us the most popular genre in different regions by the tooltip feature in a worldmap.  <br/>
    The right bar chart with statistical percentage calculation feature clealy addresses the need to select a publisher for a given genre. We just need to select the publisher with the largest percentage of games in that genre. 
    
    <br/>

    <p style="font-size: 12px;"> *Q2: (1) The D3 conveniently combines the data analysis and pretty data visualization together in one framework.<br/>
        (2) There are so many open-source template or examples online to make pretty visualization figures for our data analysis.<br/>
        (3) D3 is written in JavaScript using many functions so we can reuse the code and these functions to make data visualization for similar tasks to improve efficiency.
    <br/>

    <p style="font-size: 12px;"> *Q3: (1) For simple and small dataset like 2 columns and less than 10 rows, D3 will not be the best tool, instead Excel or Pandas would be much faster.<br/>
        (2) Since D3 is open-source so if we are working on private dataset with deliberate concerns, we should not use D3.<br/>
        (3) Since D3 doesn't always support older browsers, we should not use D3 for data visualization if we are working on some projects that will need support on older browsers.    
        <br/>

    <p style="font-size: 12px;"> *Q4: As the reading “Why Accessibility Is at the Heart of Data Visualization” said, special attentions
        should be paid to make equivalent experience for all our readers. My dashboard contains 3 figures all with color fillings. 
        They will be very helpful for healthy user to distinguish the category difference.
        However, these colors in my dashboard may be hard to distinguish for some color-blind people even I used color with reasonable contrast. Also, my "Calculate Percentage" button may not be accessible to people 
        who needs assistive device since reading the HTML tag to find the button is not convienient for these people. However, 
        my dashboard conveys the necessary informations that is not dependent on colors. For example, 
        the length of each bar in the bar chart can tells us the top sellers. Also the size of each portion in 
        the pie chart can tell us the top publisher in each game genre. To improve current dashboard for accessibility,
        I can build the percentage calculation shown on the pie chart directly rather than using the button to help people who needs assistive device to have better access to the results. 
    
    <p style="font-size: 12px;"> *Q5: One factor is that myself is not strong at distinguishing colors so I had a hard time to choose the good color scheme so I kept the same scheme as in the lab. Also for the map, I am not sure if every reader is good at geography to distinguish the four location. 
        For example, the sales from north america may be mistakenly considered as the sale only in US since the marker is located in US. 
        However, change the marker size to cover the whole north america area may cause another confusion about what the circle size means. This concern dismissed me to do further change.
